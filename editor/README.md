# 4D-Debugger-VSCode

This extension developed by **[4D](https://www.4d.com/)** provides a debugger for the **[4D language](https://developer.4d.com/docs/Concepts/about)**.


## Quick start

1. Install the 4D Debugger extension in VS Code.
2. Declare your default 4D Server path in the Settings.
3. Open a 4D project folder and run a 4D method (.4dm) file.
4. Start debugging.

All 4D blog posts about this extension are available [here](https://blog.4d.com/tag/vscode/).

## Requirements

- The 4D Debugger extension can only be used with 4D Server 20 R8 or higher.
- The VS Code with 4D Debugger extension and 4D Server must be on the same machine. 
- No other debugger must be [attached to 4D Server](https://developer.4d.com/docs/Debugging/debugging-remote).

The following properties can be set in the `launch.json` file for each project.

## About Port number

The port number of the remote debugger cannot be modified directly; it is however the Application Server port+2. See [4D Server and port numbers](https://developer.4d.com/docs/settings/client-server#4d-server-and-port-numbers).
